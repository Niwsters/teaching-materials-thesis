\section*{Abstract}
For shareable teaching materials to work as intended, they need to be accessible to possible recipients. In this study, accessibility is defined as being obtainable and usable. \\[0.5cm]
The obtainability aspect is primarily explored via literature study. The usability aspect is analysed by testing of existing teaching materials. The methodology is inspired by usability testing methods found in computer science and IT. \\[0.5cm]
