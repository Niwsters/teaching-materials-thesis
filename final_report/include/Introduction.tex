\chapter{Introduction}

Teachers often design their own teaching materials. When sharing these materials with each other, many problems may appear: Misunderstood abbreviations, unclear purpose and structure, and lack of adaptability that require time and resources for reworking the material.

Usability testing is a method used in software development that can be used to discover these problems in a cheap, efficient and easy-to-do manner. As the usability testing proponent Krug proposes [KÃ„LLA], these tests can be used for other projects outside of software development. This study explores the use of usability tests in the context of teaching materials, and how it can be done effectively, even by teachers lacking in previous knowledge of usability design.

More specifically, this study aims to answer the research questions below.

\section{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How can usability testing be adopted to improve the usability of teaching materials?
	\item How can usability testing as a method be made accessible for teachers with limited experience of usability design?
	\item What factors do teachers consider when deciding on how to use a teaching material?
	\item From the perspective of a technological system, how can usability design for teaching materials be used to help teachers?
\end{enumerate}
